How do I approach designing software.

---I approach designing software by breaking it down into sections that I need to work on. I start with whatever is the most base part of my program, which for this project was making the shapes, and plan out how to apply the next parts after that. I also do a lot of writing down and notes on how things should be working and make design graphs to show which parts talk to each other. Like how in my program the camera controls talk to the camera header file and in my design graphing I make lines from the camera file to the inclusion line and than to where it is used in the program. 

How do I approach developing programs.

---I approach designing software as if someone will be picking up after me right away and needs to know what I wrote and how it works. So I add comments to most of what I write either describing it or detailing how it works. Through this project I learned more on how to do that when it comes to commenting how something will show on screen and what changing code will do to the final output. I also picked up the habit of using comment lines accross the screen to seperate sections of my code so when you read it you know what each section is meant to do. A practice I'm sure I can make use of in the future to help keep my code easy to read. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

---Computer science is my goal and I hope to advance in the field. This class though has taught me alot. I learned how to better visualize my code since in this class I had the opertunity to see a digital recreation of what my code was doing and could see how certain changes affected the program as a whole. It also taught me how to better organize my code for easier reading since the code for this project required a lot of parts talking together to produce the scene.
